    I care about one thing: design has to work in the real world.  
    A logo or a visual identity should not only look good on screen, it must also work on signage, packaging, print materials, and social media.  
    My experience combines graphic design, print production, and hands-on project coordination — from preparing files to final delivery and installation.
